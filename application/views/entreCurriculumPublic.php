  <h1>Entre Curriculum</h1>
  <p>E.N.T.R.E. is an acronym that stands for <b>Entrepreneurs</b>, <b>New product development</b>, <b>Target markets</b>, <b>Research</b>, and <b>Elements of pricing and promotion</b>.  Through these five content topics, The Entre Curriculum teaches special education students the fundamentals of business, marketing, and most importantly, entrepreneurship. We wanted to create a unique curriculum that is engaging and enlightening for special education students. While planning the Entre Curriculum, we modeled the structure of the curriculum in a similar way of other business curriculums.s</p>
